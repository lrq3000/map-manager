MAP-MANAGER CHANGELOG
=====================

From v1.0 to v1.1: 2013-02-16
-----------------------------
x Critical security risk: mapremote.php?remove can ../ (directory traversal), should filter that!
x arena infos not parsed into bsplist index file at upload (but at rebuildfull OK)
x add download link in table
x rebuildfull does not clean the thumbdir before putting the new files
x reuploading a map (after manual deletion) does not update the resources in thumbdir (no overwrite). It should!
x sometimes, the .txt files are uploaded at the root and with filename '.txt' (no prefixed name!).
x case no more matters (eg: MAP.pk3 and map.pk3 can no more be both uploaded). This is necessary for extended resources, where the case may differ (the readme MAP.txt can be called maP.txt or whatever, so we must deal with it).
x mapremote.php remove did not clean the thumbnails directory
x now accepts more than .jpg for levelshots (can configure any image extension we want) + tga are automatically converted to jpg to be able to show them in a web browser.

From v0.0.1 to v1.0 (first public release): 2013-02-16
------------------------------------------------------
x blacklist + already uploaded files automatically blacklist (just compare the name ou crc, si l'un des deux coincide alors nope)
x read files directly from zip: all levelshot, all txt (first levelshot is shown as thumbnail)
x bsp list dans txt: reprendre le code de oa-clan-planner?
bspname pk3name crc
mapname (bsp no ext)|md5 ou sha1|pk3from
json encode!
mapname -> array avec more infos
x Try/Catch pour enregistrer fichier et log bsp, et catch rollback garder en mémoire le log bsp
x admin page remove pk3 and metadata log
x limit number of successful uploads per day per ip (session) to 5 (configurable in config.php) EXCEPT admin
x check at least 1 bsp and size > 0
prevent pk3 with 0 size bsp?
x engine consider pk3 files as soon as they contain .pk3, even if there's something else after. So filter any file that contains \.pk3.*
x filesize checking clientside and progress bar
x HTTP download (get list with full webpath, a script can work with that afterwards)
x reCaptcha
x upload files (multiple files) voir si ca fonctionne (faire le script php necessaire)
x mapname.arena file parse and use data (on pourrait le storer dans bsplist? ou extract?)
crc ok?
x file uploader ajax log write in file optionally?
x bug when upload file: temp file gets _ instead of - in name. Dans la fct aux, car $_REQUEST['name'] est OK.
x manage AJAX error messages (show them: for example if the checkFile is false).
x map lister table cells background color change every line alternatively
x login page (ajoute delete dans le listing des maps) en utilisant session
x If a pk3 which is not a zip is uploaded, what happens? try/catch to delete the temp file?
x Fixed a bug in maplister complaining that there was no $_SESSION['auth']
x Added AGPL logo at the bottom
