MAP-MANAGER TODO
================


TODO
----
- Nothing here!

MAYBE/SOMEDAY
-------------

- filter by gametype (looking at the $bsp['type'] that is coming from the .arena file - NOT available for all maps, eg: openarena standard maps because .arena are stored separately in another pk3).
- allow ratings
- connect to b3 ratings?
